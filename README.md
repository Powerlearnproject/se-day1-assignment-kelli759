Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is designing and maintaining a software used to solve a problem.
importances include:1. ensures reliability and efficiency this creating high quality and bug free applications to solve problens. ii) Perfomance- it ensures that a software can handle growth of an enterprise. iii) data protection- due to high number of technology hacking, software engineers play key role in securing systems and protecting the data.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i) the term software was first coined in 1968 at NATO conference in response to the software crisis  where projects were becoming more complexand costly hence more prone to failure. The conference emphasized the need for structured methododlogies ,systematic testing and software development.
ii) The rise of structured programming( 1970-1980) -this was mainly to improve software reliability and maintanability.
iii) The Agile Revolution ( 2001 - to date )- this was introduced to promote iterative development, flexibility and close collaboration between developers and stakeholders. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i) planning- is the initial stage involving identifying project goals, feasiability analysis, resource allocation and risk assessment.
ii) Requirement analysis- is where developers and stakeholders gather and define detailed software requirements.
iii) deisgn- is the system architecture and software components designedbased on requirements.
iv) implementation- is where developers write the actual code based on the design documents.
v) testing- the software is tested for bugs  and perfomance considering security vulnerabilities.
vi) deployment- once tested and approved, the software is released to users.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
i) Approach- Waterfall methodology is sequential and linear while Agile methology is iterative and incremental
ii) Phases- Waterfall methodology has defined stages while Agile methodology is repeated cycles.
example ;- waterfall is appropriate where the project has well defined and stable requirements that are unlikely to change.
         - agile is appropriate where customer involvement is high and needed.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
i) Software engineer-is responsible for designing, coding and implementing software solutions based on project needs.
ii) Quality Assurance Engineer- ensures the software meets quality standards by indentifying and fixing defects before release.
iii) Project Manager- he/she sees the software development process ensuring  that projects are completed on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
importance of IDE: i) code efficiency- offers wider varriety of tools that speed up development.
                  ii) error detection - real time error checking  to help developer fix issues early.
     example ;Visual Studio Code
 importance of VCS ( Version Control System) :i) history tracking- maintains a record of every code  chnages thus enabling previous versions needed.
                                              ii) back up and recovery- protects against data loss by storing project history in remote repositories.
        example ; github                                      

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 i) Managing complex codebase- the codebase becomes more difficult as the project grows. this can be solved by use of modular programming and design patterns to keep code maintanable.
  ii) Debbuging and fixing bugs- identifying and resolving bugs take much time. it can be solved by using logging and debugging tools.
  ii) balancing speed and quality- a person tend to write code with limited time without considoring the output of the code. This can  be fixed by following best practices to ensure code quality.
  iv) Understanding and implementing security - Security vulnerability can lead to data breach and system failures. This can be solved by following secure coding practices.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
i) Unit Testing- it focuses on testing individual components or functions of a programin isolation. It ensures that each unit code works correctly.
ii) Integration Testing- verifies that different modules or components of a system work together as expected. It identifies issues related to data flow .
iii) System Testing- is evaluation of entire application as a whole to ensure it meets functional and non-functional requirements. It identifies issues related to system perfomance, security and usability.
iv) Acceptance Testing- Determines whether the software meets end-user and business requirements before release. Helps identify missing requirements or last-minute bugs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs to optimize the response of AI models.
importance;- i) Enhances AI output quality thus a more clear and accurate context-aware responses.
             ii) Improves efficiency and reduces misinterpretations thus reducing the need for follow up clarifications.
             iii) enables customization for different use cases thus the   AI responses for specific needs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example; explain science.improved prompt woubld be( explain the impact of artificial intelligence on the healthcare industry including its benefits and challenges. )
